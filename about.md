Hello visitor üëã, welcome to my place on the internet

I go by **fastbyte** in the cyber realm but IRL my name is Aldeesh. Currently I'm a student pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering.  I focus on the Offensive side of cybersecurity but I dabble in blue team activities from time to time. 

I constantly grind on HackTheBox and Tryhackme to improve my red-teaming skills.
I'm a "Pro hacker" on HTB and _top 1% globally_ with "God" rank on tryhackme.

Apart from that I participate in CTFs and enjoy solving past CTF challenges.

Outside the infosec realm, I enjoy reading a lot. My main intrests are fiction novels, comics and manhwas. Watching animes is also a major hobby of mine.

If you have anything to ask or wanna root some boxes together feel free to shoot a dm üèπ .
